## Project Overview

### **Objective**
The goal of this project is to develop a web or mobile-friendly platform where users can:
- Request car maintenance or repair services (a “mobile workshop”).
- View available services, packages, and costs.
- Book appointments for mechanics to come on-site or pick up the vehicle.
- Track service status and history.

### **Key Features**
- User-friendly service scheduling system.
- Transparent pricing and service details.
- Mechanic dashboard to manage requests and updates.
- Administrator tools to oversee operations.

### **Key Actors & Use Cases**
- **Customer:** Register, book services, track appointments, and view history.
- **Mechanic:** Manage incoming service requests, update job statuses, and communicate with customers.
- **Administrator:** Oversee users, services, and platform analytics.

## System Requirements

### **Functional Requirements**
- User authentication (secure password hashing, role-based access control).
- Service listing with descriptions and prices.
- Scheduling and booking system with real-time availability checks.
- Service status tracking and notifications.
- (Optional) Payment handling and receipt generation.
- (Optional) Review and feedback system.

### **Non-functional Requirements**
- **Performance:** Support concurrent user interactions and multiple requests.
- **Security:** Enforce secure authentication, HTTPS, and access controls.
- **Scalability:** Designed for future growth.
- **Maintainability:** Well-documented, modular codebase with error tracking.

---

## Technology Stack

### **Backend (Python)**
- **Framework:** Flask (flexible) or Django (feature-complete with built-in admin panel).
- **API:** Flask-RESTful or Django REST Framework.

### **Database**
- **Relational:** PostgreSQL or MySQL.
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy (Flask) or Django ORM.

### **Frontend**
- **Options:** HTML/CSS/JS (server-rendered) or React/Vue/Angular (SPA approach).
- **Responsive design:** Optimized for web and mobile use.

### **Deployment**
- **Hosting:** AWS, Azure, GCP, or PaaS like Heroku/DigitalOcean.
- **Containers:** Optional use of Docker for environment consistency.

### **3rd Party APIs**
- **Geolocation:** Google Maps or Mapbox.
- **Notifications:** Twilio (SMS), Firebase Cloud Messaging (push notifications).
- **Payments:** Stripe, PayPal, or local payment gateways.

## Development Plan

### **1. Planning & Requirements**
- Finalize project scope and features.
- Identify necessary 3rd-party APIs.

### **2. Database Schema Design**
- Define tables: Users, mechanics, services, appointments, payments (optional).
- Establish relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many).

### **3. API Development**
- Authentication: `/api/register`, `/api/login`, `/api/logout`.
- Services: `/api/services` (CRUD operations).
- Bookings: `/api/bookings` (CRUD operations).
- Mechanic requests: `/api/mechanic/bookings` (GET/PUT for status updates).
- Admin tools: Routes for managing data.

### **4. Frontend Development**
- Wireframe and design UI components.
- Develop service listings, booking forms, and dashboards.
- Implement mobile responsiveness.

### **5. Testing & QA**
- Unit tests for backend APIs.
- End-to-end testing (user login → service selection → booking → status updates → payment).
- User acceptance testing with a test group.

### **6. Deployment & Maintenance**
- Deploy to cloud hosting platform.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines and environment variables.
- Monitor logs and fix issues post-launch.

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk                      | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Scope Creep               | Define MVP, prioritize features. |
| Security Vulnerabilities  | Implement HTTPS, secure authentication. |
| Scalability Issues        | Use optimized database queries and caching. |
| Poor User Adoption        | Ensure intuitive UI, build trust with reviews. |

---

## Next Steps
- Finalize feature list and requirements.
- Create UI wireframes and mockups.
- Set up a Python backend prototype.
