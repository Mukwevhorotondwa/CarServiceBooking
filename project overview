1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
1.1 Project Description
Objective: Build a platform (web or mobile-friendly) where users can:
Request car maintenance or repair services (a “mobile workshop”).
View available services, service packages, and costs.
Book appointments for mechanics to come on-site or pick up the vehicle.
Track service status and history.
Goals:
Provide an easy-to-use scheduling system for users to request on-site car service.
Offer transparent pricing and service details (e.g., oil change, tire replacement, battery check).
Allow mechanics or service providers to manage requests, schedules, and user communications.
1.2 Key Actors and Use Cases
Customer
Sign up / Log in(in progress denje)
View available services and related costs
Request car service, choose timeslots
Track booking status
View service history and receipts
Mechanic / Service Provider
View assigned or incoming service requests
Accept or reject requests
Update job status (in progress, completed)
Communicate with customers (messaging or status updates)
Administrator
Manage overall platform (users, services, pricing)
Oversee service provider availability
Review system logs or analytics

2. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
2.1 Functional Requirements
User Registration & Authentication
Use secure password hashing for user credentials.
Implement role-based access (customer, mechanic, admin).
Service Listing
Present a list of services with details (name, description, price range).
Scheduling & Bookings
Users can pick a timeslot for service.
Real-time availability checks for mechanics or service providers.
Confirmation via email/SMS (optional).
Service Status Tracking
Track request status (pending, accepted, in progress, completed).
Provide push/email notifications when status changes (optional).
Payment Handling (Optional/Advanced)
Integrate payment gateways or handle in-app payments for services.
Store payment records and generate digital receipts.
Review and Feedback System (Optional)
Customers can rate the service and provide feedback.
2.2 Non-functional Requirements
Performance: System should handle multiple service requests and user interactions concurrently.
Security:
Enforce role-based permissions.
Use HTTPS with SSL certificates in production.
Scalability:
Use a database and architecture that can grow with increased traffic.
Maintainability:
Organize code and documentation for easy updates.
Implement logging and error tracking for debugging.

3. TECHNOLOGY STACK
3.1 Backend (Python)
Framework:
Popular choices: Flask or Django.
Flask is simpler and more flexible; Django is more feature-complete (ORM, admin panel, etc.).
REST API:
Use Flask’s Flask-RESTful or Django’s Django REST Framework (if using Django).
3.2 Database
Relational: PostgreSQL or MySQL
Good for structured data (users, services, appointments).
ORM:
Flask: SQLAlchemy
Django: Built-in ORM
3.3 Frontend
Options:
A standard server-side rendered app (HTML templates, Jinja2 in Flask or Django Templates).
A separate SPA (Single Page Application) using React, Vue, or Angular calling the Python API.
Responsive Design:
Ensure the web app works on mobile browsers if you do not plan a separate mobile app.
3.4 Deployment
Hosting:
Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) or smaller PaaS (Heroku, DigitalOcean).
Containers (Optional):
Docker for containerizing the application.
3.5 3rd Party APIs (Examples)
Geolocation: To identify user or mechanic location (Google Maps, Mapbox).
Notifications: Twilio for SMS, Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications, etc.
Payments (if needed): Stripe, PayPal API, or any local payment gateway.

5. DEVELOPMENT PLAN
Planning & Requirements
Finalize features and project scope.
Identify required 3rd-party APIs (geolocation, payment, messaging).
Database Schema Design
Tables for users, mechanics, services, appointments, payments (optional).
Decide relationships (e.g., one mechanic can have many appointments).
API Endpoints
Authentication: /api/register, /api/login, /api/logout
Services: /api/services (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
Bookings: /api/bookings (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
Mechanic: /api/mechanic/bookings (GET/PUT for status updates)
Admin: Could have separate routes for managing data (if needed).
Frontend Design & Development
Create wireframes/mockups (see below for design sources).
Develop the UI for listing services, booking forms, and dashboards.
Implement responsive design.
Integration & Testing
Test end-to-end: user login -> select service -> create booking -> mechanic updates -> user sees status -> payment (if applicable).
Write unit tests for Python backend routes and logic.
Conduct user acceptance testing with a small group.
Deployment & Maintenance
Deploy to a chosen platform (AWS, Heroku, etc.).
Implement continuous integration and version control (Git).
Monitor logs, fix bugs, plan updates.

8. RISKS AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES
Scope Creep
Risk: Additional features (e.g., live chat, location tracking) can bloat the project.
Mitigation: Establish clear MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and prioritize features.
Security Vulnerabilities
Risk: Poor handling of user data can lead to data breaches.
Mitigation: Follow best practices (HTTPS, secure password storage, role-based access).
Scalability
Risk: The app might slow or crash with increased users if not designed for growth.
Mitigation: Use a robust database, implement caching, and design the system with load balancing in mind (if needed).
User Adoption
Risk: Users might not use the app if the UX is confusing or if trust is lacking.
Mitigation: Ensure a seamless, user-friendly design and build trust elements (ratings, reviews, secure payments).

9. NEXT STEPS
Finalize Requirements: Meet with stakeholders to ensure features align with business goals.
Wireframe & Design: Create or source UI designs from recommended platforms (Figma, Dribbble, etc.).
Technical Prototyping: Set up the Python environment, test a basic “hello world” or minimal REST API to confirm architecture approach.
Database & Data Models: Map out tables/collections, finalize relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many).
Iterate & Test: Develop incrementally, continuously test each feature (TDD/BDD approach recommended).
Launch: Deploy the MVP version, gather feedback, and improve accordingly.
